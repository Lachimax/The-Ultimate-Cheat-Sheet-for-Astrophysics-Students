		\begin{description}			
			\item[Basis:] A set of linearly independent vectors which span a vector space; that is, any vector in that space can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors.
			
			\item[Bijective:] A function that is both injective and surjective.
			
			\item[Co-domain:] The set of numbers which contains, but may not be limited to, the range of a function. That is, all of a function's outputs are in its co-domain.
			
			\item[Commute:] Two matrices commute if $[A,B] = 0$; ie, $AB = BA$.
			
			\item[Complex transpose:] Hermitian adjoint.
			
			\item[Convex set:] In a convex set, all points on a line connecting any two elements are also in the set.
			
			\item[Complete: ] If every Cauchy sequence converges to a vector in a vector space, that space is complete. All finite complex vector spaces are complete.
			
			\item [Closure (of a set):] Both the boundary and interior points of the set.
			
			\item [Column space (of a matrix):] The subspace of $\mathbf{R}^n$ spanned by the columns of the matrix. That is, if a vector is a linear combination of the columns of the matrix, it is in the column space of that matrix.
			
			\item [Consistent system of equations:] If a system has one or more solutions, it is consistent. If it has no solutions, it is inconsistent.
			
			\item[Diagonal Matrix:] A matrix with non-zero entries only in its diagonal.
			
			\item[Differentiability (of a multivariable function):] If the partial derivatives of a function $f(\vec{x})$ exist and are continuous at $\vec{x} = \vec{a}$, then $f(x)$ is differentiable at $\vec{a}$
			
			\item[Dimension:] The minimum number of vectors required to span a vector space; or, the definitive number of vectors in a basis of that space.
			
			\item[Domain (of a function):] The set of numbers from which a function's inputs are chosen.
			
			\item[Finite-dimensional vector space:] A vector space spanned by a finite set of vectors; or, with a finite basis.

			\item[Eigenspace:] A vector space for which the eigenvectors of a matrix form a basis.
			
			\item[Hermitian:] A matrix which has its Hermitian adjoint equal to itself.
			
			\item[Hermitian adjoint:] The Hermitian adjoint $A^\dagger$ is the transpose of $A$, with each entry replaced by its complex conjugate. Also known as the complex transpose.
			
			\item[Hilbert Space:] A complex, inner-product space that is complete.
			
			\item[Image:] ?
			
			\item[Inconsistent system of equations:] A system of equations is inconsistent if it has no solutions. If it has one or more solutions, it is consistent.
			
			\item[Injective (function):] for every input, there is exactly one output. Every input is mapped to only one output by the function. (also one-to-one)
			
			\item[Inner product:] A product that satisfies conjugate symmetry, linearity in the first argument and positive-definitiveness (in quantum physics, the rule is linearity in the second argument).
			
			\item[Imaginary Matrix:] A matrix with all imaginary entries.
			
			\item[Kernel (of a transformation):] All of the points in a transformation's domain that will be sent to zero. (also nullspace)
			
			\item[Linear independence:] A vector is linearly independent of another if it cannot be written as a linear combination of the other. A set of vectors is linearly independent if all of the members are linearly independent of each other
			
			\item[Linear isomorphism:] a linear transformation that is bijective. If $T$ is an isomorphism, so is its inverse $T^{-1}$
			
			\item[Nullity:] The dimension of the nullspace of a matrix.
			
			\item[Nullspace (of a transformation):] All of the points in a transformation's domain that will be sent to zero. (also kernel)
			
			\item[Normal:] A vector is normal when it has magnitude 1.
			
			\item[Orthogonal:] When two vectors are orthogonal, their inner product is zero. See also perpendicular.
			
			\item[Onto:] The range of the function is identical to the co-domain. Also surjective.
			
			\item[Orthonormal set:] A set of vectors, especially a basis, in which all the vectors are both normal and orthogonal to each other.

			\item[Parallel:] 
			
			\item[Perpendicular:] A ninety-degree angle.
			
			\item[Pivot column (of a matrix):] A column containing a pivot variable.
			
			\item[Pivot variable (of a matrix):] The first non-zero entry in a row of a matrix.
			
			\item[Positive-definite (operation or function): ] Outputs are greater than zero, except when inputs are zero, in which case equal to zero.
			
			\item[Range (of a function):] The set of a function's outputs.
			
			\item[Rank (of a matrix):] The dimension of the vector space spanned by the columns of a matrix; or, the number of leading ones (or pivot variables)in the row-reduced matrix.
			Also equal to the dimension of the image of the matrix.
			
			\item[Rank-Nullity Theorem:] The number of columns in a matrix is equal to the rank of the matrix plus the nullity of the matrix. 
			Or, the dimension of the nullspace plus the dimension of the image is the number of columns.
			
			\item[Real matrix:] A matrix with all real-valued entries.
			
			\item[Row space:] the subspace of $\mathbf{R}^n$ spanned by the row vectors of a matrix.
			
			\item[Span:] A set of vectors spans a space if any vector in the space can be written as a linear combination of the set.
			
			\item[Subspace:] A set of vectors within a space forming their own vector space. The conditions for a subspace are:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Must be closed under addition
				\item Must be closed under scalar multiplication
				\item Must contain the null vector
			\end{enumerate}
			
			\item[Surjective (function):] The range of the function is identical to the co-domain. Also onto.
			
			\item[Symmetric Matrix:] A square matrix which is symmetric across the diagonal.
			
			\item[Trace:] The sum of the diagonal entries of a matrix.
			
			\item[Transpose:] $A^T$, the transpose of $A$, is the reflection of $A$ across its diagonal. Only works with square matrices.
			
			\item[Vector space:] Any set of linearly independent vectors.
