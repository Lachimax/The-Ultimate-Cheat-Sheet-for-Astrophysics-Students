\section{Version History}
\begin{description}
\item[v 0.1 2016:] This project is begun in a trio of physical exercise books as \textit{The Little Book of Physics Formulae}, \textit{The Little Book of Mathematics Formulae}, and \textit{The Little Book of Astronomy Formulae}
\item[v 0.6 2016:] The process of transferring the formulae from paper to LaTeX is initiated, but abandoned (or drifted away from).
\item[v 0.7 2018-03-20:] The project is resurrected (probably because the author started MRes), uploaded to Overleaf, and cleaned up.
\item[v 0.8 2018-07-12:] Remaining formulae imported from the original books.
\item[v 0.9 2018-07-26:] Further formulae imported from undergrad formula sheets.
\item[\href{http://www.webofworlds.net/s/ultimate-astrophysics-cheat-sheet_1-0.pdf}{v 1.0 2018-07-28}:] First public release, with some additions from 0.9.
\item[\href{http://www.webofworlds.net/s/ultimate-astrophysics-cheat-sheet_1-0-1.pdf}{v 1.0.1 2018-07-31}:] Minor corrections, added "dynamical timescale" (2.2.2) and some more formulae to the Statistics chapter (it was looking a little bare).
\item[\href{http://www.webofworlds.net/s/ultimate-astrophysics-cheat-sheet_1-1.pdf}{v 1.1 2019-11-29}:] Font change; added Planck units and some other miscellaneous units to Units of Measurement; fine structure constant to Physical Constants (why wasn't it already there?); stellar luminosity; formulae for Green's functions and other differential equation techniques; minor corrections; Gaussian distributions to Statistics section; more detailed unit circle.
\item[\href{http://www.webofworlds.net/s/ultimate-astrophysics-cheat-sheet_1-1-1.pdf}{v 1.1.1}:] Cosmological equations; minor typographical corrections (correct differential operator and bracket sizes); added pixel scale equation; using siunitx for units now (wip); correction to Earth mass in units.
